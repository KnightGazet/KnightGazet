**Welcome to Our Project in Computer Science!ðŸ’¡**
- The application we created for this project is about hospital management!


**More Information!:**
- Using the PyQt5 Library, we developed a basic graphical user interface (GUI) for our program. 
- Using the SQLite3 Library, we developed a basic database with three tables that include information about doctors, patients, and their appointments.
- We can add, modify, and remove doctor patient data and appointments in this program, which can potential help run the hospital.
- We've even created a "about" page with information about our hospital and other contact information.
